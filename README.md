# Climate-Change-Modeling
Climate Change Modeling: Analyzing NASA's comprehensive climate dataset to predict environmental changes and inform sustainability initiatives. Leveraging machine learning and statistical techniques to uncover insights and forecast future climate trends.

# Overview

This project aims to develop and apply statistical and machine learning models to analyze and predict climate change patterns. The goal is to better understand the impacts of climate change and inform decision-making for mitigation and adaptation strategies.


# Dataset

The project utilizes the NASA Climate Change dataset, which includes:

- likesCount records
- profileName Data
- commentsCount data
- Text Data
- date

# Models

The project implements the following models:

- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest

Statistical Models:

- ARIMA
- Linear Regression

Machine Learning Models:

- LSTM
- Random Forest


# Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- TensorFlow (for LSTM model)


# Installation

1. Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. This will install all the required libraries specified in the requirements.txt file.
3. Download the NASA Climate Change dataset and update the data_path variable

The project requires the following libraries:

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy (numpy)
- Pandas (pandas)
- Matplotlib (matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn (scikit-learn)
- Statsmodels (statsmodels)
- TensorFlow (tensorflow) (for LSTM model)


requirements.txt is a text file that lists the dependencies required to run a Python project.

-r requirements.txt is a command-line option used with pip, the Python package installer.
-r stands for "requirement" or "requirements file."

When you run pip install -r requirements.txt, pip:

1. Reads the requirements.txt file.
2. Installs each package specified in the file.
3. Ensures the specified package versions are installed.


The requirements.txt file typically contains:

- Package names (e.g., numpy, pandas)
- Package versions (e.g., numpy==1.20.0, pandas==1.3.5)
- Optional dependencies (e.g., tensorflow for LSTM model)


Using pip install -r requirements.txt provides several benefits:

- Simplifies dependency management.
- Ensures consistency across environments.
- Saves time by installing all dependencies at once.


Example requirements.txt file:

numpy==1.20.0
pandas==1.3.5
matplotlib==3.4.3
scikit-learn==1.0.2
statsmodels==0.13.2
tensorflow==2.8.0


To generate a requirements.txt file for your project:


1. Run pip freeze > requirements.txt in your terminal/command prompt.


This command lists all installed packages and their versions, redirecting the output to requirements.txt.
